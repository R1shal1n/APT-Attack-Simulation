# Velvet Chollima APT Adversary Simulation

This is a simulation of an attack by the (Velvet Chollima) APT group targeting South Korean government officials. The attack campaign began in January 2025 and also targeted NGOs, government agencies, and media companies across North America, South America, Europe, and East Asia. The attack chain starts with a spear-phishing email containing a PDF attachment. However, when targets attempt to read the document, they are redirected to a fake device registration link instructing them to run PowerShell as an administrator and execute attacker-provided code. This simulation is based on research from Microsoft's Threat Intelligence and Bleeping Computer: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dprk-hackers-dupe-targets-into-typing-powershell-commands-as-admin/

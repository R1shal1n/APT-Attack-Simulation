# APT Attack Simulation
This repository is a compilation of all Russian, Chinese, Iranian and North Koreans APT simulations that target many vital sectors,both private and governmental. The simulation includes written tools, C2 servers, backdoors, exploitation techniques, stagers, bootloaders, and many other tools that attackers might have used in actual attacks. These tools and TTPs  are simulated here. I relied on Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, Kaspersky, Microsoft, Cisco, Trellix, CrowdStrike and WithSecure to figure out the details to make this simulations.

The names of APT groups vary from one company to another, and in this simulations I have followed the names approved by CrowdStrike.

These are all the names of the APT groups, and I simulated one attack for each group.
